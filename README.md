I'm actively seeking a challenging **Full-Stack Software Engineer** role where I can leverage my skills in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, cloud technologies, databases, and system design to contribute to innovative projects. I'm a lifelong learner, currently deepening my knowledge in **C++, C#, and TypeScript**, and pursuing the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification.

Beyond coding, I enjoy the process of creating and sharing knowledge, which is why I document my Leetcode problem-solving journey on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ebarcly). I'm also fluent in both English and Spanish.
