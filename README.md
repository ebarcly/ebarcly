## About Me ðŸš€

I'm a results-driven Software Developer passionate about building robust and scalable applications. With professional experience in backend and full-stack development using **JavaScript (NodeJS)** and **Python**, I thrive on solving complex problems and creating efficient solutions. My experience includes:

* Engineering full-stack web applications that contributed to significant client revenue (over $500K).
* Optimizing application performance, achieving up to 40% faster load times.
* Designing, deploying, and managing scalable cloud solutions on **AWS** using **Docker**.
* Developing mobile applications for both **iOS (SwiftUI)** and cross-platform **(React Native)**.
* Leading projects using **Agile (Scrum)** methodologies to enhance delivery efficiency and client satisfaction.

I'm actively seeking a challenging **Backend or Full-Stack Software Engineer** role where I can leverage my skills in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, cloud technologies (especially AWS), databases, and system design to contribute to innovative projects. I'm a lifelong learner, currently deepening my knowledge in **C++, C#, and TypeScript**, and pursuing the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** certification.

Beyond coding, I enjoy the process of creating and sharing knowledge, which is why I document my Leetcode problem-solving journey on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ebarcly). I'm also fluent in both English and Spanish.
